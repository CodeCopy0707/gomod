### 🧠 General Intelligence & Natural Language Processing
- **Advanced NLP with Gemini**: Utilize the latest Gemini AI models to interpret complex, multi-step natural language instructions (e.g., "Build a full-stack e-commerce app with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Stripe payments"). Support multilingual inputs, including Hindi (e.g., "Mujhe ek login page chahiye jo Tailwind aur Next.js use kare").
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Decompose user prompts into logical, actionable steps, generating a detailed execution plan with milestones. Document each step in a human-readable format for transparency.
- **Intent Recognition & Clarification**: Infer user goals from ambiguous or incomplete prompts, proactively asking clarifying questions (e.g., "Should the login page include OAuth2 or JWT authentication?").
- **Self-Critique Mechanism**: Continuously evaluate generated code, suggestions, and actions for correctness, efficiency, and alignment with user intent, iterating until optimal results are achieved.
- **Context Retention**: Maintain a persistent memory of the entire conversation, project state, open files, command history, and user preferences to ensure seamless, context-aware interactions.
- **Dynamic Context Compression**: Summarize and prioritize relevant context (e.g., active files, recent changes, or project goals) to optimize Gemini API calls, reducing token usage and improving response times.

### ⚡ Performance Core
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combine Go’s high-performance capabilities (e.g., goroutines for parallelism, low-latency file operations) with Node.js for seamless integration with JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems (e.g., npm, Yarn, Webpack).
- **Multi-Threaded Execution**:
  - Use Go’s goroutines for parallel tasks like file indexing, code analysis, and prefetching.
  - Implement Node.js Worker Threads for JavaScript-heavy tasks (e.g., linting, autocompletion).
  - Optionally integrate Python’s `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for auxiliary scripting tasks.
- **Low-Latency Design**: Optimize for real-time performance with asynchronous I/O, event-driven processing, and minimal response times, even for large codebases (>10,000 files).
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamically allocate CPU and memory based on task complexity, with fallback mechanisms for low-resource environments (e.g., laptops vs. cloud servers).
- **Scalability**: Ensure the agent can handle projects ranging from single scripts to enterprise-scale applications with thousands of files and dependencies.

### 📁 Advanced File Handling & Codebase Awareness
- **File System Operations**:
  - Support creating, reading, writing, deleting, renaming, and moving files/folders using Node.js `fs.promises` and Go’s `os`/`io` packages.
  - Implement batch operations for efficiency (e.g., bulk file updates or directory restructuring).
  - Handle file permissions, symbolic links, and cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Grep-Based Code Search**:
  - Integrate `grep`-like functionality (e.g., using `ripgrep` or custom regex-based search) to find code patterns, function definitions, or variable usages across the codebase.
  - Example: Search for all instances of `useState` in React files or `func` declarations in Go files.
  - Cache search results for quick re-access and support incremental searches for large projects.
- **Codebase Indexing**:
  - On project load, create a real-time index of all files, including metadata (file type, size, last modified, dependencies).
  - Use AST parsing (via TreeSitter or Chevrotain) to map code structures, such as functions, classes, and imports.
  - Maintain a file tree with real-time updates to reflect changes (e.g., new files, renamed modules).
- **Context-Aware File Tracking**:
  - Track active files, recently modified files, and working directory context to provide relevant suggestions.
  - Detect file dependencies (e.g., `import` statements, Go modules) to ensure holistic codebase awareness.
- **Modularization & Refactoring**:
  - Automatically split large files into smaller, reusable modules based on functionality (e.g., separate API routes from database logic).
  - Remove code duplication using AST-based analysis, adhering to DRY principles.
  - Suggest and apply folder structures for scalability (e.g., `src/controllers`, `src/models`).

### 💻 Terminal Integration & Command Execution
- **Terminal Command Execution**:
  - Execute shell commands (e.g., `ls`, `git commit`, `npm install`, `go build`, `docker run`) with support for Bash, Zsh, and PowerShell.
  - Handle complex command pipelines (e.g., `grep -r "error" . | sort | uniq`) and environment variable management.
  - Support cross-platform command variations (e.g., `dir` on Windows vs. `ls` on Linux).
- **Command Automation**:
  - Automatically select and run appropriate commands based on task requirements (e.g., `npm init` for a new Node.js project, `go mod tidy` for Go dependency cleanup).
  - Generate and execute multi-step command sequences (e.g., `git init && npm install && npm start` for project setup).
- **Error Handling & Recovery**:
  - Parse terminal output and stack traces to identify errors (e.g., missing dependencies, syntax errors).
  - Suggest or apply fixes (e.g., `npm install missing-package` or correcting a malformed `Dockerfile`).
  - Maintain a command history with success/failure logs for debugging and retry logic.
- **Interactive CLI Interface**:
  - Provide a conversational, real-time terminal interface where users can input natural language or traditional commands.
  - Support command aliases, auto-suggestions, and tab-completion for common tasks.
  - Offer a REPL-like experience for iterative coding and testing.
